Measures of carbon in the atmosphere.

Concentration(s) of \ce{CO2}:
usually reported as ppmv (parts per million by volume, mole fraction)

In order to convert to mass fraction ppmm (parts per million by mass) multiply by \frac{44.0095}{28.97} = 1.519 (44.0095 molar mass of \ce{CO2}, 28.97 molar mass of the atmosphere).

To determine mass of \ce{CO2} in the atmosphere multiply mass fraction by mass of atmosphere $5.1480 \times 10^18$ kg.

Partial pressure of \ce{CO2} is equal to mass fraction.

Mass of carbon in the atmosphere is the mass of \ce{CO2} multiplied by \frac{28.97}{44.0095} = 0.2729

*Insert table

1 Gt = 10^9 t = 10^12 kg
