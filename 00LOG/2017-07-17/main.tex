Don handed me draft one of a new paper called "A Reservoir Model for the Evolution of Carbon in the Earth's mantle," quietly joking, that this in essense is the backbone of my master's thesis. The goal is to have a typed manuscript with the time frame of one to two weeks. Marie Weisfeiler has kindly shared her manuscript including latex files and figures on dropbox lokavarpuh@gmail.com. 

I also continued to further extend the reservoir carbon diagram.
