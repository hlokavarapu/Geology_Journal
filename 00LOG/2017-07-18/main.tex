I typed up the introduction, descriptions of core, continental crust and atmosphere for the digital paper version 'A reservoir model for the evolution of carbon in the Earth's mantle.'

I also compiled ConMan version 3.0 and submitted the test suite. Results will be located as the log entry file of this date on Ymir. \path{/home/hlokavar/Geology_Journal}
